    <p><strong>Quick Take for Your Exams:</strong> Stop cramming! This smart technique helps you remember information for the long haul (and for your exams) by reviewing it just as you're about to forget it.</p>
    <p><strong>üóìÔ∏è What Is It?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A learning technique that involves reviewing information at gradually increasing intervals.</li>
      <li>Based on the 'forgetting curve' ‚Äì we forget things over time if not reviewed.</li>

  howTo: [
    "**1. Learn It First:** Understand the material initially.",
    "**2. First Review (Soon):** Review it shortly after (e.g., end of the day or next day).",
    "**3. Space It Out:** Subsequent reviews are spaced further apart (e.g., after 3 days, then a week, then 2 weeks, etc.).",
    "**4. Use Tools (Optional):** Flashcard apps like Anki often have built-in spaced repetition algorithms, great for exam vocab or facts."
