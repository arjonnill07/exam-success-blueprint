      <div><strong>‚è≥ What:</strong> Review what you learn at smart intervals‚Äîright before you‚Äôre about to forget. Each review strengthens your memory for exams!</div>
      <div><strong>üí° Why it works:</strong> Your brain forgets fast (see the curve below), but every review resets the curve and makes your memory stronger. That‚Äôs why toppers don‚Äôt cram‚Äîthey review smartly!</div>
      <div class="flex flex-col items-center my-4">

        <span class="text-blue-700 text-xs">The Forgetting Curve: Each review flattens the drop!</span>
      </div>
      <div><strong>‚ö° How to use it:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>First, learn the topic well.</li>
          <li>Review after 1 day, then 3 days, then a week, then 2 weeks, and so on.</li>
          <li>Use flashcards or apps (like Anki) to remind you when to review.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> After learning a new Math formula or English word, set reminders to review it tomorrow, in 3 days, and next week. Watch how it sticks!
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world Eureka:</strong> Think of your memory like a leaky bucket. If you pour in water (review) just before it‚Äôs empty, you never run dry! That‚Äôs how toppers remember so much for board exams and beyond.
