    <div class="space-y-3">
      <div><strong>üîÑ What:</strong> Mix different types of questions or subjects in one study session.</div>
      <div><strong>‚ùì Why:</strong> Exams always mix things up! This trains your brain to switch and adapt‚Äîno surprises on test day.</div>
      <div><strong>‚ö° How:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>Pick 2-3 topics (e.g., Algebra, Geometry, English).</li>
          <li>Do 1-2 problems from each, then switch. Repeat.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> Mix 2 Math sums, 2 English grammar, 2 Science MCQs. Notice how you have to think harder!
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world connection:</strong> Imagine you‚Äôre preparing for your SSC or HSC exams. In your Math session, instead of solving 10 algebra problems in a row, you do 2 algebra, 2 geometry, and 2 statistics problems. Then, you switch to English and do a grammar fill-in-the-blank, a summary, and a translation. This way, your brain gets used to switching between topics‚Äîjust like you‚Äôll have to do in the real exam, where questions are never grouped by type!<br/><br/>
        <em>Bonus:</em> If you‚Äôre studying Science, try mixing up MCQs from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in one sitting. You‚Äôll notice you get better at quickly figuring out what each question is really asking, and you‚Äôll feel more confident on exam day.
