    <div class="space-y-3">
      <div><strong>‚õ∞Ô∏è What:</strong> Imagine learning as climbing a mountain‚Äîeach step takes you higher, from basic facts to creative thinking.</div>
      <div><strong>üí° Why it matters:</strong> Exams (SSC, HSC, class tests) ask questions from every level. If you only memorize, you‚Äôll get stuck at the bottom. Climb higher to ace MCQs, short answers, essays, and projects!</div>
      <div><strong>üöÄ How to level up:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Remember:</strong> Recall facts (MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks).</li>
          <li><strong>Understand:</strong> Explain in your own words (short answers).</li>
          <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Use knowledge in new situations (problem-solving, science experiments).</li>
          <li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Break down ideas, compare, find patterns (essay, data analysis).</li>
          <li><strong>Evaluate:</strong> Judge, argue, or justify (debate, critical response).</li>
          <li><strong>Create:</strong> Design, invent, or write something new (project, story, experiment).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> Take any topic (e.g., Photosynthesis). Ask yourself: Can I recall the formula? Explain it? Predict what happens if sunlight is blocked? Compare C3 and C4 plants? Suggest a new experiment? You‚Äôre climbing the mastery mountain!
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world Eureka:</strong> You already use Bloom‚Äôs steps every day! When you learn a cricket shot, you first remember the rules, then understand the grip, apply it in practice, analyze your mistakes, evaluate your performance, and finally create your own style. Learning for exams works the same way‚Äîclimb step by step, and you‚Äôll reach the top!
