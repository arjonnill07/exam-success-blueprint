      <div><strong>üìù What:</strong> Practice pulling answers from your memory‚Äîno peeking! It‚Äôs like doing mock tests before the real thing.</div>
      <div><strong>üí° Why it works:</strong> Every time you try to recall info, your brain builds stronger memory paths. It‚Äôs proven: testing yourself beats just rereading notes!</div>
      <div><strong>‚ö° How to use it:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>Use past board questions, class tests, or make your own quiz.</li>
          <li>Answer without looking at your book or notes (closed book!).</li>
          <li>Check your answers, then focus on what you missed.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> After studying a chapter, close your book and write down everything you remember. Or, ask a friend to quiz you with last year‚Äôs board questions!
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world Eureka:</strong> Think of it like cricket practice: you don‚Äôt just watch matches, you play practice games! The more you test yourself, the more confident you‚Äôll be on exam day‚Äîno surprises, just results.
