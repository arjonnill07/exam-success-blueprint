    <p><strong>Quick Take for Your Exams:</strong> This is a powerful way to make information 'stick' for exams. Instead of passively re-reading, actively pull facts from your brain!</p>
    <p><strong>üß†üîç What Is It?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The act of deliberately trying to remember information without looking at your notes.</li>
      <li>It forces your brain to work, strengthening memory pathways.</li>
      <li>Far more effective than just re-reading or highlighting for exam preparation.</li>
