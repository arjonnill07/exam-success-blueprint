    "**1. Identify Weak Spots:** Analyze past exam papers or practice tests. Where do you consistently lose marks or feel unsure?",
    "**2. Set Specific Goals:** Instead of 'get better at math,' aim for 'correctly solve 5 integration problems of type X'.",
    "**3. Focused Practice:** Work *only* on those specific problem types or concepts. Minimize distractions.",
    "**4. Seek Feedback & Reflect:** Immediately check your work. Understand *why* you made errors. How can you avoid them in the exam?"
