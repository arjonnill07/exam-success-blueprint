  longDescription: `
    <div class="space-y-3">
      <div><strong>üñºÔ∏è What:</strong> Turn ideas into pictures, just like you did as a child when you imagined stories or drew your first map of your neighborhood. Your brain already knows how to do this!</div>
      <div><strong>üí° Eureka! Why it works:</strong> Remember how you never forget the route to your best friend‚Äôs house, or the look of your favorite cricket field? That‚Äôs visualization! When you turn lessons into pictures, your brain says, ‚ÄúI know this!‚Äù and locks it in for the exam.</div>
      <div><strong>üîó Connect the dots:</strong> Every new topic is like a new stop on your mental map. The more you connect it to what you already know (like linking the water cycle to the rain you see every monsoon), the easier it is to remember.</div>
      <div><strong>‚ö° How to spark a Eureka moment:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>Draw a mind map for a chapter (e.g., Biology: Cell Structure) and add doodles or colors that remind you of real life.</li>
          <li>Make a flowchart for a process (e.g., Chemistry: Acid-Base Reaction) and imagine it as a recipe you‚Äôd follow in the kitchen.</li>
          <li>Turn a poem or story into a comic strip or storyboard in your notebook.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> Next time you read about the water cycle, close your eyes and picture the rain falling on your school roof, running into the pond, then rising as steam in the hot sun. Draw it out and add a funny detail‚Äîlike a frog with an umbrella!
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world Eureka:</strong> When you‚Äôre stuck in an exam, don‚Äôt just remember words‚Äîsee the picture you created. That‚Äôs how toppers recall tricky diagrams, timelines, or even grammar rules. The secret? They make it personal and visual.<br/><br/>
        <em>Bonus:</em> For HSC Biology, sketch the human heart and label the parts, then imagine the blood as a red bus making stops. For English, make a mind map of a story‚Äôs main events and connect them to your own life. Suddenly, it all makes sense!
