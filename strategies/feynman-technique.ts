    <div class="space-y-3">
      <div><strong>ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What:</strong> Become a teacher, detective, and storyteller! Explain any topic as if you‚Äôre teaching a 10-year-old, a friend, or even your parents. If you can do that, you truly understand it.</div>
      <div><strong>üí° Why it works:</strong> Teaching forces your brain to organize, simplify, and connect ideas. If you get stuck, you‚Äôve found your weak spot‚Äînow you know exactly what to fix before the exam!</div>
      <div><strong>‚ö° How to use your superpower:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
          <li>Pick a topic you want to master (e.g., Math theorem, Biology process, English poem).</li>
          <li>Explain it out loud or write it down as if your listener is much younger or new to the subject.</li>
          <li>Use simple words, stories, or even doodles‚Äîno jargon allowed!</li>
          <li>Notice where you hesitate or get confused. That‚Äôs your clue to review and try again.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="bg-sky-50 border-l-4 border-sky-400 p-2 rounded">
        <strong>Try it now:</strong> After studying a tough chapter, call a friend or sibling and explain it in your own words. Or, teach your pillow! If you can make them (or yourself) say ‚ÄúOh, now I get it!‚Äù‚Äîyou‚Äôre exam-ready.
      </div>
      <div class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2">
        <strong>Real-world Eureka:</strong> Ever noticed how the best students are always helping others? That‚Äôs their secret! When you teach, you learn twice. You‚Äôll spot gaps, build confidence, and maybe even become the go-to genius in your group.
