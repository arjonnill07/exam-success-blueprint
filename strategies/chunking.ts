    <p><strong>Quick Take for Your Exams:</strong> Feeling swamped by a huge topic? Chunking is the way to make it totally manageable and less scary for exams! We'll turn mountains into molehills.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸ§© What Is It?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Break large amounts of information (like a whole exam syllabus) into smaller, meaningful units or 'chunks'.</li>
      <li>Each chunk is easier to process, understand, and remember.</li>
      <li>Focus on one chunk at a time before connecting them for the bigger picture.</li>

  howTo: [
    "**1. Identify the 'Whole':** Pinpoint that large exam topic or chapter that feels overwhelming.",
    "**2. Slice It Up:** Break it into smaller, logical sub-topics or sections. Think about how exam questions might target these parts.",
    "**3. Master Each Chunk:** Focus on understanding one chunk thoroughly before moving to the next.",
    "**4. Connect the Chunks:** Once individual chunks are clear, actively link them to understand the overall concept for the exam."

    "<em>Preparing for a Biology exam covering cellular respiration:</em> Chunk it into Glycolysis, Krebs Cycle, and Electron Transport Chain. Study each pathway's inputs, outputs, and significance separately first."
