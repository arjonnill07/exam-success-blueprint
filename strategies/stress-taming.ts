    "**1. Power Breathing:** Inhale slowly for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6-8. Do this 3-5 times before entering the exam hall or when you feel anxious.",
    "**2. Positive Self-Talk:** Swap 'I‚Äôll fail!' for 'I‚Äôve prepared, I can do this!' Write your favorite phrase on a sticky note or in your notebook.",
    "**3. Mindfulness Mini-Break:** Focus on your senses‚Äîwhat do you see, hear, feel? This grounds you in the present and calms racing thoughts.",
    "**4. Preparation Ritual:** The night before, pack your bag, lay out your uniform, and review your notes calmly. This routine signals your brain: 'I‚Äôm ready.'",
    "**üí° Try it now:** Before your next study session, do 3 deep breaths and say one positive thing to yourself. Notice the difference!"

  realWorldExamples: [
    `<strong>Night Before SSC/HSC:</strong> Can‚Äôt sleep? Try 5 minutes of deep breathing or listen to a calming audio. <em>Eureka!</em> You‚Äôll fall asleep faster and wake up fresher for the exam!`,
    `<strong>Exam Hall Nerves:</strong> Heart racing before the first question? Pause, do 3 power breaths, and repeat your positive phrase. <em>Try it now:</em> You‚Äôll feel your mind clear and your confidence rise!`,
