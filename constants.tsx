      <p><strong>Quick Take for Your Exams:</strong> Prepares your brain for the mixed-up nature of real exams! Instead of studying one topic to death (blocking), you switch between different topics or problem types.</p>
      <p><strong>üîÑ What Is It?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A study strategy where you mix, or 'interleave,' different topics or types of problems within a single study session.</li>
        <li>Contrasts with 'blocked practice' (studying one topic fully before moving to another).</li>
        <li>Helps the brain learn to differentiate between concepts and choose the right solution strategy, crucial for exams.</li>

      "**3. Embrace the Initial Difficulty:** It might feel harder at first than blocked practice, but the long-term learning and exam adaptability are greater.",
      "**4. Space It Out Too:** Combine interleaving with spaced repetition for even better results for your exams."
